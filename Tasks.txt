Part 1
You must create a database that contains the following tables:
- developers (stores data about developers)
- skills (developer skills - Java, C ++, etc.)
- projects (projects on which developers work)
- companies (IT companies in which developers work)
- customers (customers who are customers of projects in IT companies)

Wherein:
- everywhere ManyToMany
- developers can have many skills
- Each project has many developers who work on it
- companies perform many projects simultaneously - customers have many projects
It is necessary to implement both tables and competent links between them.
The result of the job is a project that contains files in the resources folder.

Part 2
It is necessary to compile queries that perform the following tasks:
1. Add developers a field (salary - salary).
2. Find the most expensive project (based on PP developers).
3. Calculate the total Salary of all Java developers.
4. Add a field (cost - cost) to the Projects table.
5. Find a customer that brings the least profit to the company for each company.
6. Calculate, the average Salary of programmers in the project, which brings the lowest profit.
The result of the job is a project that contains the files initDB.sql (creating tables and links between them) in the resources folder, populateDB.sql (filling in the tables with data), 1.sql, 2.sql, 3.sql, 4.sql, 5 .sql, 6.sql, each of which receives data for each of the items in the job.


Use MySQL.
